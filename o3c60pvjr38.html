<h2 data-label="638952" class="ltx_title_subsection">Introduction&nbsp;</h2><div>For this analysis, I used open source data from CitiBike. CitiBike is the bike sharing system serving New York City and Jersey City. Many New Yorkers utilize CitiBike. According to CitiBike's monthly report, there were 146,533 active annual members by the end of June 2018, and an average of 65,098 CitiBike trips per day in June 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The question I considered for my analysis was "Are people in their 30s less likely to use CitiBike for commuting than people in their 20s?" Using CitiBike to commute to work is a healthy and ecfriendly and healthy option. I wondered if the proportion of CitiBike commuters decreases as people get older. My findings could potentially inform programs to encourage people of all ages to bike to work.&nbsp;</div>
