<div>This paper presents ananalysis, I did a statistical test of CitiBike data. I wanted to test the hypothesis that people in their 30s are less likely than people in their 20s to use CitiBike for commuting, e.g. that there is an association between age and using CitiBike for commuting. My results obtained via the Chi-Square test showed that there is an association between age and CitiBike ridership.&nbsp;</div>
