<h2 data-label="641535" class="ltx_title_subsection">Methodology&nbsp;</h2><div>To test my hypothesis, I used the Chi-Square Test for Proportions. I chose this statistical test because I am comparing two proportions - proportion of 30s weekend riders and proportion of 20s weekend riders. My data is categorical. Either a rider is in their 20s or their 30s. Either a ride occurs on a weekend or a weekday.&nbsp; The Chi-Square test is also the test that was recommended by my peer reviewer, Nathan Caplan.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>INSERT CONTINGENCY TABLE HERE&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Figure 3: Chi Square contingency table for my two categories (20s riders and 30s riders).&nbsp; This&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>a description of the methodology (test) chosen, the motivation behind it, a discussion of alternative options that were not adopted.
