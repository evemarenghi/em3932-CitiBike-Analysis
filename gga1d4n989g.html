The z-test can also be used to compare proportions. I did not use the z-test because the z-test is a comparison of a sample and a population. In my data, I do not have a sample and a population, I have two samples. A test that compare two samples is the t-test. I did not use the t-test because the t-test compares the mean of two samples. For my hypothesis, I wanted to compare two proportions, not the mean of two samples.&nbsp;</div>
