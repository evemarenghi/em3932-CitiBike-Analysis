<div></div><div>Figure 1a: Distribution of CitiBike rider ages (20s or 30s) for June and December 2015, absolute counts. We can see from the chart that in total, there are more CitiBike riders in their 30s than in their 20s. We also see that there are lower total rides on Saturdays and Sundays compared to weekdays for both age groups.</div><div></div><div>I normalized the distribution of riders in their 20s and riders in their 30s by dividing by the total number of rides for each age group. This allowed me to do a comparison of proportions rather than a comparison of absolute numbers.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>INSERT PLOT 2 HERE</div><div></div><div>Figure 2: Distribution of CitiBike rider ages (20s or 30s) for June and December 2015, normalized</div><div></div>
