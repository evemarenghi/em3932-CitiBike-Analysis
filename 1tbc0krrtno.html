<h2 data-label="536357" class="ltx_title_subsection">Data&nbsp;</h2><div>For this analysis I used open source CitiBike data from June 2015 and December 2015. I included two months of data to address seasonality in ridership. I removed null values from the data and limited the dataset to riders who were born between 1988 and 1998.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>I plotted the number of trips by day of week for riders in their 20s and 30s.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>INSERT PLOT 1 HERE</div><div></div><div>Figure 1a: Distribution of CitiBike rider ages (20s or 30s) for June and December 2015, absolute counts. We can see from the chart that in total, there are more CitiBike riders in their 30s than in their 20s. We also see that there are lower total rides on Saturdays and Sundays compared to weekdays for both age groups.</div><div></div><div>I normalized the distribution of riders in their 20s and riders in their 30s by dividing by the total number of rides for each age group. This allowed me to do a comparison of proportions rather than a comparison of absolute numbers.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>INSERT PLOT 2 HERE</div><div></div><div>Figure 2: Distribution of CitiBike rider ages (20s or 30s) F2015, normalized</div><div></div><div>a description of the data you use and how it is processed. This should include figures (with captions!!) that help visualize and understand the data.</div>
