<h2 data-label="536357" class="ltx_title_subsection">Data&nbsp;</h2><div>For this analysis I used open source CitiBike data from June 2015 and December 2015. I included two months of data to address seasonality in ridership. I removed null values from the data and limited the dataset to riders who were born between 1988 and 1998. I also added a 'day of week' column to my dataset to identify weekday and weekend trips.</div><div></div><div>I plotted the number of trips by day of week for riders in their 20s and 30s.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
