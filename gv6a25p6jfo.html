<div>To test my hypothesis, I used the Chi-Square Test for Proportions. I chose this statistical test because I am comparing two proportions - proportion of 30s weekend riders and proportion of 20s weekend riders. My data is categorical. Either a rider is in their 20s or their 30s. Either a ride occurs on a weekend or a weekday.&nbsp; The Chi-Square test is also the test that was recommended by my peer reviewer, Nathan Caplan.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Contingency table for Chi-Sq</div>
