<div>Figure 3: Chi Square contingency table for my two categories (20s riders and 30s riders). I used the contingency table to calculate the expected ratio for each cell.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>My calculated Chi-Square value was 16.6. I compared this value to the Chi-Square table for 1 degree of freedom and significance level = 0.05. The value obtained from the Chi-Square table for&nbsp;1 degree of freedom and significance level = 0.05 was 3.84. Since my Chi-Square value 16.6 &gt; 3.84, I rejected the null hypothesis that the proportion of weekend rides is independent of age (20s vs. 30s).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>An alternative test that I considered using was the z-test.
